## Description

Fuego Fortress is Nikki Fuego's 2023 Game Jam submission. In this scene Nikki used AI for every single texture, skybox, NPC dialogue, NPC style concepts, and maze layout on each floor. This entire scene was made in SDK7 with the Visual Studio SDK7 Editor Extension. This is an 8x8 estate. The entirity of this scene was made during the Game Jam duration; nothing here was reused from previous projects.

## How to Play

1. Talk to Hynkay or read the "How to Play" poster to get basic instructions.
2. Once you reach the start area you will have the start-hatch and a go-back cube. You can interact with the cube to go back to the entrance area or you can click on the start-hatch to begin the maze.
3. Once you begin you will navigate your way down the tower as fas as you can while collecting as many stars as you can.
4. Once you rach the bottom floor you will need to click on the tesseract cube to end the maze. You will be teleported to the end area and be presented with the ending dialogue!
